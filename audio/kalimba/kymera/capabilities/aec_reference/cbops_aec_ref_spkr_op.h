 * insert samples in stream if there is insufficient input
 * to produce the desired output. It acts on all its channels in tandem,
 * so amounts, when instantiated as multi-channel operator, match across
 * channels - this makes it act in "sync". If sync is not desired, then
 * instantiate the operators as single-channel instances and let them act
 * completely independently of each other.
