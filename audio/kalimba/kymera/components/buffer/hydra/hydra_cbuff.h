/* cbuffer presents buffers to code running on the Kalimba as stores
 * of "words", where a word is dependent on the Kalimba core
 * (24 or 32 bits).
 *
 * The MMU/BAC hardware, and lower layers of the buffer software
 * (e.g. mmu), present buffers as stores of octets (to the outside
 * world, e.g. PCM hardware, and to local software).
 * The amount of significant data in each 'word' might not be the
 * full RAM occupancy of that word; e.g. on Amber, to the buffer
 * hardware, only 16 bits of each 24-bit RAM word contain 'real'
 * data, and the buffer offset only increments by 2 octets per
 * word of RAM occupied.
 *
 * These macros represent the relationship between these two levels
 * of abstraction -- "offsets per word of RAM".
 *
 * Also these macro names are a bit ropey for their purpose.
 * Also mind the ptr_to_octet and octet_to_ptr in hydra_mmu_private.h
 *
 * Note: These macros are only used in code that is not expected to
 * execute on platforms with BAC32 (eg: cbuffer_copy_remote_buff)
