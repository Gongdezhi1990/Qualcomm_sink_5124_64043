/**
 * Cbuffer structure
 *
 * The cbuffer structure can encapsulate a simple SW buffer, a local MMU buffer,
 * or a remote MMU buffer (this is mainly Hydra terminology).
 * Bluecore has "ports" to MMU buffers that are in the MMU hardware module
 * - shared between DSP and MCU (XAP); we still consider BC MMU buffers as "local",
 * they are similar to hydra BAC buffers, although "owned" by the DSP they are a separate HW module.
 *
 * In the case of a remote buffer (hydra), we interpret the read_ptr and write_ptr somewhat liberally;
 * we use the field to store a compressed Hydra mmu_handle. (They're guaranteed to fit,
 * because mmu_handles only contain 12 useful bits - this is a hardware constraint.)
 *
 * \note See http://wiki/AudioCPU/architecture/Buffers for a better explanation of this.
